        <p>Intro blurb.<br>
            The FitnessGram PACER Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.<br>
            <br>
            The test is used to measure a student's aerobic capacity as part of the FitnessGram assessment. Students run back and forth as many times as they can, each lap signaled by a beep sound. The test get progressively faster as it continues until the student reaches their max lap score.</p>
